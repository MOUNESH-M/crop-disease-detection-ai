# crop-disease-detection-ai
A deep learning project that detects crop leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the PlantVillage dataset. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and deployed using Flask.

# Smart Crop Disease Detection using AI
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect crop diseases from leaf images using the PlantVillage dataset.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN Model
- Flask
- GitHub

## Goal
Classify images of plant leaves into categories like:
- Tomato - Early Blight
- Potato - Late Blight
- Corn - Rust
- Healthy Leaves

## Status
- Day 1: Dataset setup and exploration
- Day 2: Data Pre-processing and visualization
- Day 3: CNN model built, trained and evaluated
- Day 4: Day 4: Model evaluation, saving, and custom image prediction
