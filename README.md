# crop-disease-detection-ai
A deep learning project that detects crop leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the PlantVillage dataset. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and deployed using Flask.

# Smart Crop Disease Detection using AI
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect crop diseases from leaf images using the PlantVillage dataset.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python (Google Colab)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN Model
- Flask (optional, for deployment)
- GitHub
